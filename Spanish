# Spanish

I've tried to learn Spanish aroudn 4 or 5 times in the past 10 years, even though I enjoyd it. I kept getting to a certain level and then not getting through the final barrier and for various reasons stopping.

So this is a way of solidifying my understanding and what I've learned to share the learning journey.
